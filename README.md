Hi!

My name is Damir Akchurin. I'm a PhD Candidate at the Department of Civil and Systems Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. My current research focuses on investigating the system reliability of steel structures.

Fun fact about me: My name means "steel" or "iron" in most Turkic languages.
